#Need to create a edit-profile page which is separate to the profile page. The edit page will be the one i already have(the form and the text), the profile will just have the text
#so if a user has already entered in data, it will be in the database and you can retrieve it from there and display on profile page. 2nd last else statment in the profile
# function above should work.
#Might need an if statement to check if there's a bio in the database, if there is display, otherwise just display their name and no bio

#Also look into how to do pop ups on the homepage rather than redirecting to a new page.

#when a user clicks on profile for the first time-It will only display their name and the form.
#when a user types in their bio for the first time, it stores in a session and then displays this for the user.--This however is not saved when the user logs out.
#implemented a way to grab the information from the database and display on the profile page.
#So if the user_profile has a bio in the database then it gets that. This acts as a way of saving their information to their profile page
#implemented an if statment to check if the profile_bio in user_profile has an id. If it does, we want to update it to reflect the new form data. Otherwise just insert into the database.

#Implemented a way to be able to restrict the user to only create account and login pages at first until they login. They can't access the profile page or home page until they log in.
